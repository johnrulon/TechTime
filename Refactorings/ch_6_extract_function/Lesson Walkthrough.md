# Steps for walking others through these examples

## Refactorings covered by Dice Roll and Levenshtein Distance
### Extract Function
- Replace comment with function
- Replace repeated code with function
- VS Code's "Refactor" tools
- Name functions based on _what_ they do, not _how_

### Pull up field
- Moving a field "up" from a sub-class to a parent class or a method to a class

### Replace inline code with function code

### Slide Statements

### Split Variable

### Extract Variable
- If there's not a lot of logic to abstract into a method, consider introducing a variable
### Rename Variable
- Rename variable to better describe what the variable contains

## Key takeaways
We spend the majority of our time reading code versus writing code. Therefore, prefer readability over condensed or "cool" code. 

Self-documenting code, that abstracts complexity into functions that have a single and focused reponsibility, will help with readability.

From Martin Fowler's Refactorings book:
>If you have to spend effort looking at a fragment of code and figuring out _what_ it's doing, then you should extract it into a function and name the function after the _what_. ... Name it by _what_ it does, not by _how_ it does it.

> Small functions only work if the names are good, so you need to pay good attention to naming. This takes practiceâ€”but once you get good at it, this approach can make code remarkably self-documenting.

> To me, any function with more than half-a-dozen lines of code starts to smell, and it's not unusual for me to have functions that are a single line of code.

This session today will cover some refactoring patterns from Martin Fowler's book: `Refactoring - Improving the design of existing code`. These patterns are most likely ones you already follow, but knowing them, being able to identify when you're following them, can help assert you're making a worthwhile refactor. 

We'll cover a few refactorings, but knowing that with each example, other refactorings are possible and not every refactor I'll show is what I'd considered a good change.

## Die Roll Example
With Die Roll, we introduce a simple 'Extract function' refactoring.

#### Steps:
- Open the file `die_roll_before` and briefly walk them through the code
- Explain that `Repeated code` is the hint to extract a function
- The repeated code being the calls to `random.randint()`
- Explain that we want to Extract a function that will generate a random number given a range
- Show the `die_roll_after` code and walk through the refactor that was done
- Ask, "What other benefits do we gain from extracting this function?"
    - Answer: this code can now roll any number sided die
    - In the previous code we limited ourselves to 3 numbers because of our "switch" statement for 6, 8, or 12 sided die
    - This could actually be good OR bad - maybe we don't want to allow rolling oddly shaped dies

## Levenshtein Distance Example
With Levenshtein Distance, we again use 'Extract function' to start things out.

#### Steps:
- Open the file `lev_distance_before` and briefly walk them through the code
    - Ask, "Is this code self-documenting code?"
        - Answer: no, because it requires comments to make the code quickly readable (I know that can be subjective)
            - And sure, some of you could argure it's simple enough to "easily" read, but self-documenting code is code that doesn't require you to interpret the _LOGIC_ of the code, and is simple enough for most developers to follow
    - Explain that `comments` are the hint or the pattern we can see that informs us that we may want to extract a function, to extract the code into a function that is named in a way to replace the comment
- Select all the code from line 21 - 29 (the code under that first in-line comment)
    - Right click -> Refactor: shortcut is dependent upon whether you're using MacOS or Windows, but clicking Refactor gives us a hint to "Extract method"
    - Click "Extract Method"
    - Suggest that we use the comment as input to the name of the new method
        - So for this example, something like `set_len_diff_and_max_len`
    - Explain that perhaps this isn't the best outcome - to have two return values from a method
- Refactor next section of code (the first `for i range...` through the first `distance = 0`)
    - Call the method: `add_distance_of_words_in_order`
    - Talk through how maybe this refactor isn't the best result, but still does make it self-documenting
        - The return statement `return distance` on line 44 is not really needed and actually confusing because it's always going to be 0 like we want, but that feels really odd
        - Also, it passes in a lot variables as pass by reference and modifies them, and that can be ok, but let's try another way 
- Undo the Refactor
- Let's think through what Refactorings we can do prior to our goal refactoring of Extract Function
    - Introduce Slide Statement and Split Variable
        - They're exactly what they sound like: "slide" a statement up or down in code, and "split" a variable in two
        - Looking at the code we're trying to refactor, we know that `distance` is set to 0, used in the for loops to increment, stored following the for loops, and then reset back to zero. 
        - This indicates that `distance` can "slide" closer to the code needing it
        - Let's perform a "slide" of distance to our for loop we're trying to extract (line 24)
        - Recognize that we also could benefit from a "split" or else `distance` will "live" outside of the scope that we really need it to live
        - So let's split `distance` variable into two, creating a new one called `temp_distance = 0`
            - We'll then update `distance += 1` to use `temp_distance` instead, and also update the append statement to use `temp_distance`
            - We can also remove that reset of `distance = 0` following the append statement
    - By doing a couple smaller Refactorings first, we made it easier to peform the overall Refactoring that we wanted to peform of "Extract function"
    - We also enabled the next Refactor - the next for loop
- Refactor the last commented section
    - "Slide" `distance` closer to the code where it's needed
    - Rename `distance` to `temp_distance`
    - Refactor: call the method: `add_distance_of_reverse_order`
- Now review the overall code in the main method
    - Remember, the pattern we noticed of comments, and our goal to "Replace comment with function"
    - Let's remove the comments and see how it reads
    - Notice that perhaps the return might not be considered as self-documenting! 
        - Refactor that return statement by selecting `len_diff + min(distances)`
        - Notice the "Extract Variable" option: perform that action
        - With that change, I'd argue that the logic to calculate the distance is now abstracted away and by performing this "Extract vairable" refactoring, that code is now self-documenting

#### Concluding thoughts
Going through that set of refactorings we see that our code is a bit more self-documenting.

One could argue however, there are other improvements that could be made:
- For example: in reading the code now, I don't know for certain "to what" our `add_distance...` methods are adding to
    - It's not obvious it's adding to our distances array
    - That refactor would include:
        - Changes `add_distance...` methods to return distance instead of adding it to an array
        - Move the `distances.append()` code back to the main method
        - Rename the methods to `calc` instead of `add` to indicate they are only calculating the distance, not storing/adding it
    - See `lev_distance_after_2.py` for this additional refactor


 Either way, the process led us to at least slightly better 'self-documenting' code and was a good excercise nonetheless...hopefully at least :) 

 # Challenge
In code bases you work with frequently, find an example where the code could benefit from the `Extract function` refactoring.

Look for hints of either comments that can be replaced by a self-documenting method OR repeated code to extract into a shared, reusable function.
