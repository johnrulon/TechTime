# Refactorings covered by Dice Roll and Levenshtein Distance
### Extract Function
- Replace comment with function
- Replace repeated code with function
- VS Code's "Refactor" tools
- Name functions based on _what_ they do, based on its purpose

### Pull up field
- Moving a field "up" from a sub-class to a parent class or a method to a class

### Replace inline code with function code

### Slide Statements

### Split Variable

### Extract Variable
- If there's not a lot of logic to abstract into a method, consider introducing a variable
### Rename Variable
- Rename variable to better describe what the variable contains

# Key takeaways
We spend the majority of our time reading code versus writing code. Therefore, prefer readability over condensed or "cool" code. 

Self-documenting code, that abstracts complexity into functions that have a single and focused reponsibility, will help with readability.

From Martin Fowler's Refactorings book:
>If you have to spend effort looking at a fragment of code and figuring out _what_ it's doing, then you should extract it into a function and name the function after the _what_. ... Name it by _what_ it does, not by _how_ it does it.

> Small functions only work if the names are good, so you need to pay good attention to naming. This takes practiceâ€”but once you get good at it, this approach can make code remarkably self-documenting.

> To me, any function with more than half-a-dozen lines of code starts to smell, and it's not unusual for me to have functions that are a single line of code.
